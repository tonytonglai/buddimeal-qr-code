# To Run this File #
Please cd to the directory 'bmwqr', and then run a couple things... <br />
1. "npx json-server --watch db.json --port 5000"
2. "npm start"

And voila! You should have a functioning QR Code Scanner. 

## Interactability ##
Since we don't have the database yet, I've taken the liberty of utilizing a fake database instead, called json-server, which is what you call with the npx. Anyways, here, you'll want to do a few things to try it out:
- Generate a QR Code, with numbers from 1-10! They correspond to food items on the list in db.json. 
- Once you're done, please repopulate the "db.json" with the data in "OGDATA.json"! You just need to copy and paste the entire file's content in, and you're good.
